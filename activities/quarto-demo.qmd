# Exercise 1: Deduce Quarto features

`*`.  *this makes the writing italic*

`**`.  **this makes the writing bold**

`#`.  # this makes the writing in a headline - start a new title

`-`   - this make a bullet point


`\`.       #This make a new line and add space

`This is a test`.     # this create a cray highlight

`![](url)`. #![The descrition of the image goes here]

# Exercise 2: Code


How does this appear in the .qmd? The .html? So...?!

seq(from = 100, to = 1000, by = 50)

```{r}
seq(from = 100, to = 1000, by = 50)
```



\


# Exercise 3: Chunks

Quarto isn't a mind reader -- we must distinguish R code from text.
We do so by putting code inside an **R chunk**:

```{r}

```

- Put the `seq()` code in the chunk.
- Press the green arrow in the top right of the chunk. What happens in the qmd?
- Render. What appears in the html: R code, output, or both?

# Exercise 4: Practice

- Use R code to create the following sequence: 10 10 10 10
- Store the sequence as `four_tens`.
- Use an R function (which we haven't learned!) to add up the numbers in `four_tens`.

# Exercise 5: Fix this code

Code is a form of communication, and the code below doesn't cut it.

Put the code in a chunk and fix it.

Rep(x = 1, times = 10)
seq(from=100,to=1000,length=20)
theNumberofStudentsinthisclass<-27
